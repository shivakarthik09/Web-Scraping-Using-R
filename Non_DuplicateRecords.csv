Tau is a microtubule-associated protein and localizes predominantly in the axons of neurons with the primary function in maintaining microtubules stability. When the balance between tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is changed in favor of the former, tau is hyperphosphorylated and the level of the free tau fractions elevated. The hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and formation of NFTs represent a characteristic neuropathological feature in AD brain. We have discussed the role of Aβ in AD in our previous review, this review focused on the recent advances in tau-mediated AD pathology, mainly including tau hyperphosphorylation, propagation of tau pathology and the relationship between tau and Aβ.","Alzheimer’s disease, Tau, A-beta, Tauopathy, Tau hyperphosphorylation, Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles"

Extracellular beta amyloid deposition and intracellular tau hyperphosphorylation are the two pathological events that are thought to cause neuronal dysfunction in AD. Since the detailed mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD are still not clear, the current treatments are those drugs that can alleviate the symptoms of AD patients. Recent studies have indicated that these symptom-reliving drugs also have the ability of regulating amyloid precursor protein processing and tau phosphorylation. Thus the pharmacological mechanism of these drugs may be too simply-evaluated. This review summarizes the current status of AD therapy and some potential preclinical considerations that target beta amyloid and tau protein are also discussed.","Alzheimer's disease, Amyloid precursor protein, Beta amyloid, Tau, Pathogenesis, Treatment"

Studies in recent years on DBS in posterior subthalamic area (PSA), including the zona incerta and the prelemniscal radiation, have shown promising results in tremor suppression, particularly for those tremors difficult to be well controlled by VIM DBS, such as the proximal postural tremor, distal intention tremor and some cerebellar outflow tremor in various diseases including essential tremor and multiple sclerosis. The adverse effect profile of the PSA DBS is mild and transient, without lasting or striking dysarthria, disequilibrium or tolerance, in contrast to VIM DBS, particularly bilateral DBS. However, the studies on PSA DBS so far are still limited, with a handful of studies on bilateral PSA, and a short follow up duration compared to VIM. More studies are needed for direct comparison of these targets in the future. A review here would help to gain more insight into the benefits and limits of the PSA DBS compared to that in VIM in the clinical management of various tremors, particularly for those difficult to be well controlled by traditional VIM DBS.","Post subthalamic area, Zona incerta, Deep brain stimulation, Tremor"

Although Aβ is produced by normal neurons, it is shown to accumulate in large amounts within neuronal lysosomes in AD. We have recently shown that under normal conditions the majority of Aβ is localized extralysosomally, while oxidative stress significantly increases intralysosomal Aβ content through activation of macroautophagy. It is also suggested that impaired Aβ secretion and resulting intraneuronal increase of Aβ can contribute to AD pathology. However, it is not clear how Aβ is distributed inside normal neurons, and how this distribution is effected when Aβ secretion is inhibited.","Alzheimer disease, Amyloid β-protein, Colocalization, Exocytosis, Immunocytochemistry, Lysosomes"

The results of our recent experiments indicated that curcumin could protect dopaminergic neurons from apoptosis in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The death of dopaminergic neurons and the loss of dopaminergic axon in the striatum were significantly suppressed by curcumin in MPTP mouse model. Further studies showed that curcumin inhibited JNKs hyperphosphorylation induced by MPTP treatment. JNKs phosphorylation can cause translocation of Bax to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c which both ultimately contribute to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These pro-apoptosis effect can be diminished by curcumin. Our experiments demonstrated that curcumin can prevent nigrostriatal degeneration by inhibiting the dysfunction of mitochondrial through suppressing hyperphosphorylation of JNKs induced by MPTP. Our results suggested that JNKs/mitochondria pathway may be a novel target in the treatment of PD patients.","Curcumin, Dopaminergic Neuron, Curcumin Treatment, MPTP Injection, Turmeric Extract"

Therefore, prevention in the preclinical stage is likely the most effective way to decrease the incidence of this age-associated neurodegenerative condition, and its associated burden for individuals and society. Age, gender, family history, ApoE4, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol level and physical activity are all used as component of dementia risk score. There have been numerous challenges in conducting primary prevention trials in AD. Enrichment strategies for prevention studies include studying those subjects with more risk factors for AD, such as older age, those with a positive family history of late onset AD, and those who are ApoE4 positive. Each of these strategies is designed to increase the probability of developing AD thereby decreasing the sample size or the duration of follow up. Another strategy would be to target directly the pathophysiology of AD in its preclinical stages and use the biomarkers in prevention trial as surrogate markers. This will be done first in carriers of dominantly inherited early onset AD. As this research takes place networks of memory clinics must prepare to transfer new knowledge to persons interested in a preventive approach to AD.","Alzheimer disease, Risk factor, Prevention, Clinical trial, Clinical practice"

Biomarkers for PD are urgently needed to differentiate between neurodegenerative disorders, screen novel therapeutics, and predict eventual clinical PD before the onset of symptoms. Some clinical evaluations and neuroimaging techniques have been developed in the last several years with some success in this area. Moreover, other strategies have been utilized to identify biochemical and genetic markers associated with PD leading to the examination of PD progression and pathogenesis in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or saliva. Finally, interesting results are surfacing from preliminary studies using known PD-associated genetic mutations to assess potential premotor PD biomarkers.

Both reduce quality of life of PD patients and cause caregiver burden. This review aims to provide a survey of possible therapeutic options for treatment of motor and non motor symptoms of PD and to discuss their relation to each other. MAO-B-Inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, dopamine agonists and levodopa with its various application modes mainly improve the dopamine associated motor symptoms in PD. This armentarium of PD drugs only partially influences the onset and occurrence of non motor symptoms. These PD features predominantly result from non dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Autonomic features, such as seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, orthostatic syndrome, salivation, bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, sleep disorders, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction with impaired execution and impulse control may appear. Drug therapy of these non motor symptoms complicates long-term PD drug therapy due to possible occurrence of drug interactions, - side effects, and altered pharmacokinetic behaviour of applied compounds. Dopamine substituting compounds themselves may contribute to onset of these non motor symptoms. This complicates the differentiation from the disease process itself and influences therapeutic options, which are often limited because of additional morbidity with necessary concomitant drug therapy.","Motor symptoms, Parkinson’s disease, non motor features, drug therapy"
"The changing phenotype of microglia from homeostasis to disease","Xiao-Guang Luo","Sheng-Di Chen","chen_sd@medmail.com.cn","24 April 2012","It has been nearly a century since the early description of microglia by Rio-Hortega; since then many more biological and pathological features of microglia have been recognized. Today, microglia are generally considered to be beneficial to homeostasis at the resting state through their abilities to survey the environment and phagocytose debris. However, when activated microglia assume diverse phenotypes ranging from fully inflamed, which involves the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, to alternatively activated, releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines or neurotrophins, the consequences to neurons can range from detrimental to supportive. Due to the different experimental sets and conditions, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the controversial question of whether microglia are “good” or “bad.” While it is well understood that the dual roles of activated microglia depend on specific situations, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unclear, and the interpretation of certain findings related to diverse microglial phenotypes continues to be problematic. In this review we discuss the functions of microglia in neuronal survival and neurogenesis, the crosstalk between microglia and surrounding cells, and the potential factors that could influence the eventual manifestation of microglia.","Microglia, Neuroprotection, Phenotypes, Senescence, Crosstalk"

APP adaptor proteins with phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, including Dab (gene: DAB) and Numb (gene: NUMB), can bind to and interact with the conserved YENPTY-motif in the APP C-terminus. Here we describe, for the first time, the effects of RNAi knock-down of Dab and Numb expression on APP processing and Aβ production. RNAi knock-down of Dab and Numb in H4 human neuroglioma cells stably transfected to express either FL-APP (H4-FL-APP cells) or APP-C99 (H4-APP-C99 cells) increased levels of APP-C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and lowered Aβ levels in both cell lines by inhibiting γ-secretase cleavage of APP. Finally, RNAi knock-down of APP also reduced levels of Numb in H4-APP cells. These findings suggest that pharmacologically blocking interaction of APP with Dab and Numb may provide novel therapeutic strategies of AD. The notion of attenuating γ-secretase cleavage of APP via the APP adaptor proteins, Dab and Numb, is particularly attractive with regard to therapeutic potential, given that side effects of γ-secretase inhibition owing to impaired proteolysis of other γ-secretase substrates, e.g. Notch, might be avoided.","Amyloid Precursor Protein, siRNA Treatment, Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing, Conditioned Cell Culture Medium, Amyloid Precursor Protein Trafficking"

"Linking restless legs syndrome with Parkinson's disease: clinical, imaging and genetic evidence","Tasneem Peeraully & Eng-King Tan","Eng-King Tan","gnrtek@sgh.gov.sg","27 February 2012","Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both common neurological disorders. There has been much debate over whether an etiological link between these two diseases exists and whether they share a common pathophysiology. Evidence pointing towards a link includes response to dopaminergic agents in PD and RLS, suggestive of underlying dopamine dysfunction in both conditions. The extrastriatal dopaminergic system, in particular altered spinal dopaminergic modulation, may be variably involved in PD patients with RLS symptoms. In addition, there is now evidence that the nigrostriatal system, primarily involved in PD, is also affected in RLS. Furthermore, an association of RLS with the parkin mutation has been suggested. The prevalence of RLS has also been reported to be increased in other disorders of dopamine regulation. However, clinical association studies and functional imaging have produced mixed findings. Conflicting accounts of emergence of RLS and improvement in RLS symptoms after deep brain stimulation (DBS) also contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the issue. Among the strongest arguments against a common pathophysiology is the role of iron in RLS and PD. While elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra contribute to oxidative stress in PD, RLS is a disorder of relative iron deficiency, with symptoms responding to replacement therapy. Recent ultrasonography studies have suggested that, despite overlapping clinical features, the mechanisms underlying idiopathic RLS and RLS associated with PD may differ. In this review, we provide a concise summary of the clinical, imaging and genetic evidence exploring the link between RLS and PD.","Parkinson's disease, Restless-legs syndrome, Pathophysiology, Dopaminergic dysfunction."

Mitochondria provide cellular energy in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, but as an integral part of this process, superoxides and other reactive oxygen species are also produced. Excessive free radical production contributes to oxidative stress. Cells have evolved to handle such stress via various endogenous anti-oxidant proteins. One such family of proteins is the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which are anion carriers located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. There are five known homologues (UCP1 to 5), of which UCP4 and 5 are predominantly expressed in neural cells. In a series of previous publications, we have shown how these neuronal UCPs respond to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+; toxic metabolite of MPTP) and dopamine-induced toxicity to alleviate neuronal cell death by preserving ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential, and reducing oxidative stress. We also showed how their expression can be influenced by nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway specifically in UCP4. Furthermore, we previously reported an interesting link between PD and metabolic processes through the protective effects of leptin (hormone produced by adipocytes) acting via UCP2 against MPP+-induced toxicity. There is increasing evidence that these endogenous neuronal UCPs can play a vital role to protect neurons against various pathogenic stresses including those associated with PD. Their expression, which can be induced, may well be a potential therapeutic target for various drugs to alleviate the harmful effects of pathogenic processes in PD and hence modify the progression of this disease.","uncoupling proteins, mitochondria, Parkinson's disease, ATP, oxidative stress, neuroprotection"

Tau aggregation also occurs in other common neurodegenerative diseases. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be caused by tau mutations that increase the susceptibility of tau to hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, which may cause neuronal dysfunction and deposition of NFTs. 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is a potent inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a cytosolic chaperone implicated in the proper folding and functions of a repertoire of client proteins. 17-AAG binds to Hsp90 and enhances degradation of Hsp90 client protein. We sought to determine whether 17-AAG can reduce Aβ and tau pathology in the brains of AD and FTD model mice expressing Aβ or P301L mutant tau, respectively. Mice were randomized to receive 25, 5, or 0 mg/kg 17-AAG thrice weekly from age eight to 11 months. Analysis was performed by rotarod test on motor function, on the area occupied by plaques in hippocampus or NFTs in medulla tissue sections, and on mortality. A high dose of 17-AAG tended to decrease NFTs in male mice (p = 0.08). Further studies are required to confirm the effect of 17-AAG in diseases of tau aggregation.","Dementia, Mouse, Tangles, Plaques"

Old molecules with new insights","Yong Shen","Yong Shen, Rena Li","yshen@rfdn.org, rli@rfdn.org","12 October 2013","Increasing evidence suggests that inflammatory and immune components in brain are important in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and anti-inflammatory and immunotherapeutic approaches may be amenable to AD treatment. It is known that complement activation occurs in the brain of patients with AD, and contributes to a local inflammatory state development which is correlated with cognitive impairment. In addition to the complement’s critical role in the innate immune system recognizing and killing, or targeting for destruction, complement proteins can also interact with cell surface receptors to promote a local inflammatory response and contributes to the protection and healing of the host. On the other hand, complement activation also causes inflammation and cell damage as an essential immune function to eliminate cell debris and potentially toxic protein aggregates. It is the balance of these seemingly competing events that influences the ultimate state of neuronal function.

Loss of neurological function in ASD, as observed in affected children who have regressed, can be explained as neurodegeneration. Although there is research evidence of neurodegeneration or progressive encephalopathy in ASD, the issue of neurodegeneration in ASD is still under debate. Evidence of neurodegeneration in the brain in ASD includes: (1) neuronal cell loss, (2) activated microglia and astrocytes, (3) proinflammatory cytokines, (4) oxidative stress, and (5) elevated 8-oxo-guanosine levels. The evidence from this review suggests that neurodegeneration underlies the loss of neurological function in children with ASD who have experienced regression and loss of previously acquired skills and abilities, and that research into treatments to address the issue of neurodegeneration in ASD are warranted.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Autism, Neurodegeneration, Regression, Neuronal cell loss, Microglia, Oxidative stress, Cytokines"

As of yet, actual therapies are symptomatic, and neuroprotective strategies are an unmet need. Due to their capability to transdifferentiate, to immune modulate and to increase neuroplasticity by producing neurotrophic factors, adult stem cells (ASC) might fill this gap. Preclinical research in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and/or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesioned animals established persistent improvements of motor behavior after ASC-treatment. Histological/histochemical measurements in these animals evidenced an intracerebral applied ASC-induced increase of Tyrosine Hydroxylase-positive (TH+) cells with increased striatal dopamine levels, suggesting cell rescue. Likewise, clinical experience with subventricular applied ASCs in PD patients, although limited, is encouraging, evidencing neurorescue especially during the early phase of the disease. In multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, though, only marginal reduced progression of natural progression could be established after subventricular or intravasal ASC implantations.","Adult stem cells, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple system atrophy, BDNF, GDNF, Expanded MSC, Preclinical"
"Insights on altered mitochondrial function and dynamics in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration","Joseph McInnes","Joseph McInnes","j.mcinnes@jacobs-university.de","27 May 2013","In neurons, mitochondria are enriched to provide energy and calcium buffering required for synaptic transmission. Additionally, mitochondria localize to the synapse, where they are critical for the mobilization of reserve pool vesicles and for neurotransmitter release. Previously, functional defects in mitochondria were considered to be downstream effects of neurodegenerative diseases. However, more recent findings suggest mitochondria may serve as key mediators in the onset and progression of some types of neurodegeneration. In this review, we explore the possible roles of altered mitochondrial function and dynamics in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), which have highlighted the important role of mitochondria in neurodegeneration. While inheritable diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A are concretely linked to gene mutations affecting mitochondrial function, the cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in primarily sporadic diseases such as AD and PD is less clear. Neuronal death in PD is associated with defects in mitochondrial function and dynamics arising from mutations in proteins affecting these processes, including α-synuclein, DJ-1, LRRK2, Parkin and Pink1. In the case of AD, however, the connection between mitochondria and the onset of neurodegeneration has been less clear. Recent findings, however, have implicated altered function of ER-mitochondria contact sites and amyloid beta- and/or tau-induced defects in mitochondrial function and dynamics in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting that mitochondrial defects may act as key mediators in the pathogenesis of AD as well. With recent findings at hand, it may be postulated that defects in mitochondrial processes comprise key events in the onset of neurodegeneration.","Mitochondria, Neurodegeneration, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Charcot-Marie-Tooth"

FTLD is pathologically characterized by the frontal and temporal lobar atrophy. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) clinically presents with abnormalities of behavior and personality and language impairments variants. The clinical spectrum of FTD encompasses distinct canonical syndromes: behavioural variant of FTD (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia. The later includes nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA or PNFA), semantic variant PPA (svPPA or SD) and logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA). In addition, there is also overlap of FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND or FTD-ALS), as well as the parkinsonian syndromes, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The FTLD spectrum disorders are based upon the predominant neuropathological proteins (containing inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau or ubiquitin protein, e.g transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and fusedin-sarcoma protein in neurons and glial cells) into three main categories: (1) microtubule-associated protein tau (FTLD-Tau); (2) TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (FTLD-TDP); and (3) fused in sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). There are five main genes mutations leading clinical and pathological variants in FTLD that identified by molecular genetic studies, which are chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene, granulin (GRN) gene, microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT), the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP) and the charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B).

Despite these advances over more than 20 years, current data suggest that the sensitivity of accurate clinical diagnosis of DLB is still very low, although there is mounting evidence that supportive features may increase diagnostic accuracy. Although DLB remains easy to identify pathologically with different cellular pathologies differentiating it from other dementia syndromes, pathological identification using only Lewy body pathology has been shown to be inaccurate due to overlap with patients without dementia symptoms. A number of studies now suggest that a combination of cellular pathologies, which include α-synuclein and β-amyloid deposition as well as dopamine denervation, assist with differentiating this dementia syndrome from others. The clinical and pathological overlap with the tauopathy of Alzheimer’s disease still remains to be clarified. To determine more robust and independent clinicopathological correlates from Alzheimer’s disease, longitudinal prospective studies, using specific clinical batteries on dementia patients reaching the proposed criteria for DLB, with post-mortem assessment of the multiple pathologies associated with dementia, are required. Identifying genetic causes for DLB is another approach to investigate the pathogenesis of DLB. However this approach has been hindered to date by difficulties with identifying DLB clinically. The use of novel techniques is likely to advance knowledge on the pathogenesis of DLB and assist with redefining clinical and pathologic diagnostic criteria. To achieve the goal of more accurate clinical diagnosis of DLB, breakthroughs are necessary on the pathogenesis of DLB.","Dementia with Lewy bodies, Diagnosis, Genetics, Pathogenesis, Pathology"

On the one hand immune responses can exacerbate neurotoxic responses; while on the other hand, they can lead to neuroprotective outcomes. The temporal and spatial mechanisms by which these immune responses occur and are regulated in the setting of active disease have gained significant recent attention. Spatially, immune responses that affect neurodegeneration may occur within or outside the CNS. Migration of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from the periphery to the CNS and consequent immune cell interactions with resident glial cells affect neuroinflammation and neuronal survival. The destructive or protective mechanisms of these interactions are linked to the relative numerical and functional dominance of effector or regulatory T cells. Temporally, immune responses at disease onset or during progression may exhibit a differential balance of immune responses in the periphery and within the CNS. Immune responses with predominate T cell subtypes may differentially manifest migratory, regulatory and effector functions when triggered by endogenous misfolded and aggregated proteins and cell-specific stimuli. The final result is altered glial and neuronal behaviors that influence the disease course. Thus, discovery of neurodestructive and neuroprotective immune mechanisms will permit potential new therapeutic pathways that affect neuronal survival and slow disease progression.","Neurodegeneration, Neuroprotection, Migration, MPTP, MCAM, Regulatory T cell, Effector T cell, Neuroinflammation"

Until 20 years ago, FAP was thought to be an endemic disease, but FAP is known to occur worldwide. To date, more than 130 mutations in the TTR gene have been reported. Genotype-phenotype correlations are seen in FAP, and some variation in clinical presentation is often observed in individual kindreds with the same mutation and even among family members. Of the pathogenic TTR mutations, Val30Met was the first to be identified and is the most frequent known mutation found throughout the world. Studies of patients with FAP amyloidogenic TTR (ATTR) Val30Met documented sensorimotor polyneuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, heart and kidney failure, gastrointestinal tract (GI) disorders, and other symptoms leading to death, usually within 10 years of the onset of disease. Diagnosis is sometimes delayed, especially in patients without a clear family history and typical clinical manifestations, since diagnosis requires various studies and techniques such as histopathology, genetic testing, and mass spectrometry. For treatment of FAP, liver transplantation (LT) reportedly halts the progression of clinical manifestations. Exchange of an FAP patient’s diseased liver with a healthy liver causes MT TTR in the body to be replaced by wild-type (WT) TTR. Although clinical evaluations indicated that progression of other clinical symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, GI symptoms, and renal involvement usually halted after LT in FAP ATTR Val30Met patients, recent studies suggested that LT failed to prevent progression of cardiac amyloidosis in FAP ATTR Val30Met patients after LT, with this failure reportedly being due to continued formation of amyloid that derived mainly from WT TTR secreted from the transplanted non-mutant liver graft. In recent years, many therapeutic strategies have been proposed, and several ongoing therapeutic trials involve, for example, stabilizers of TTR tetramers (tafamidis and diflunisal) and gene therapies to suppress TTR expression (antisense methods and use of small interfering RNAs). These novel therapies may prove to prevent progression of FAP.","Transthyretin, Amyloidosis, Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, Senile systemic amyloidosis, Immunotherapy, Gene therapy"

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of ncRNAs that exert their function together with argonaute proteins by post-transcriptional gene silencing of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Several studies provide evidence for alterations in miRNA expression in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Among these is huntington‘s disease (HD), a dominantly inherited fatal disorder characterized by deregulation of neuronal-specific mRNAs as well as miRNAs. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) miRNA profiles from human HD and neurologically normal control brain tissues were reported. Five consistently upregulated miRNAs affect the expression of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, cell death and survival. We re-analyzed the NGS data publicly available in array express and detected nineteen additional differentially expressed miRNAs. Subsequently, we connected these miRNAs to genes implicated in HD development and network analysis pointed to miRNA-mediated downregulation of twenty-two genes with roles in the pathogenesis as well as treatment of the disease. In silico prediction and reporter systems prove that levels of BDNF, a central node in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, can be post-transcriptionally controlled by upregulated miR-10b-5p and miR-30a-5p. Reduced BDNF expression is associated with neuronal dysfunction and death in HD. Moreover, the 3’UTR of CREB1 harbors a predicted binding site for these two miRNAs. CREB1 is similarly downregulated in HD and overexpression decreased susceptibility to 3-nitropropionic-induced toxicity in a cell model. In contradiction to these observations, it is presumed that miR-10b-5p upregulation in HD exerts a neuroprotective role in response to the mutation in the huntingtin gene. Therefore, the function of miR-10b-5p and especially its effect on BDNF expression in HD requires further academic research.","Huntington, miRNA, Sequencing, Post-transcriptional regulation"

The controls exhibited a practice effect in most of the cognitive domain scores over time. Cognitive decline at 12-month in HD was found in the executive function domain but the effect of this on global cognitive score was masked by the improvement in their language domain score. The varying practice effects by cognitive domain with repeated testing indicates the importance of comparing HD patients to control group in research trials and that cognitive progression over 12 months in HD should not be judged by changes in global cognitive score. The three brief cognitive tests effectively described cognition of HD patients on cross-sectional analysis. The UHDRS cognitive component, which focuses on testing executive function and had low variance over time, is a more reliable brief substitute for comprehensive neuropsychological testing than MMSE and MoCA in monitoring cognitive changes in HD patients after 12 months.","Huntington’s disease, Disease progression, Cognition, UHDRS, Longitudinal"

Clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, brain images (CT/MRI), neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment were performed. Multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the association in CRF between FTD patients vs. controls. The mean age in FTD was 69.7 ± 0.9 vs. 70.1 ± 0.8 in controls (p 0.12). No difference in gender was observed between cases and controls. No differences were identified between patients and controls regarding hypertension (HTA) (65% vs. 67,3% p 0.44); dyslipidemia (57% vs. 54.7% p 0.74); obesity (39% vs. 27.6% p 0.14) and hypothyroidism (26% vs. 17.1% p 0.1). A significant difference was observed for Diabetes Mellitus (39% vs. 22.6% p 0.001). In our population, Diabetes Mellitus was associated as an independent risk factor for FTD.

Targets for intervention have been identified, therapies are being developed, and clinical trials are advancing. A major challenge for FTD research is that multiple underlying pathologies can be associated with heterogeneous phenotypes. The neuropsychological profiles associated with FTD spectrum disorders often include executive dysfunction, language impairments and behavioral disturbance. Behavioral variant FTD is characterized by an initial presentation of changes in personality, behavior and/or emotion, which are often difficult to objectively capture using traditional neuropsychological measures. The two principal language variants of FTD are Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia (PNFA) with predominant agrammatic/non-fluent impairments and Semantic Dementia (SD) with semantic impairments and visual agnosia. Selection of appropriate endpoints for clinical trials is critical to ensure that the measures are adequately sensitive to detect change, yet specific enough to isolate signal from noise, and acceptable to regulatory agencies. Given the anticipated potential for small effect sizes, measures must be able to identify small incremental changes over time. It is also imperative that the measures provide adequate coverage of the constructs or behaviors of interest. Selected outcome measures should be suitable for repeat administration, yet relatively robust to practice effects to ensure that observed changes reflect true signal variance and not residual effects due to repeated measurement or poor reliability. To facilitate widespread adoption as an endpoint, measures should be readily accessible. We provide several examples of potential global, composite, and individual cognitive measures, as well as behavioral measures promising for FTD trials. Development and application of appropriate trial outcomes is critically important to success in advancing new treatments for FTD patients.","Frontotemporal dementia, Primary endpoints, Secondary endpoints, Randomized controlled trial, Methods"

"Considerations on the role of environmental toxins in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease pathophysiology","Francisco Pan-Montojo","Francisco Pan-Montojo","francisco.pan-montojo@med.uni-muenchen.de","09 May 2014","Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive dysfunction of the nervous system. Often associated with atrophy of the affected central or peripheral nervous structures, they include diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementias, Genetic Brain Disorders, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Huntington’s Disease, Prion Diseases, and others. The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has increased over the last years. This has had a major impact both on patients and their families and has exponentially increased the medical bill by hundreds of billions of Euros. Therefore, understanding the role of environmental and genetic factors in the pathogenesis of PD is crucial to develop preventive strategies. While some authors believe that PD is mainly genetic and that the aging of the society is the principal cause for this increase, different studies suggest that PD may be due to an increased exposure to environmental toxins. In this article we review epidemiological, sociological and experimental studies to determine which hypothesis is more plausible. Our conclusion is that, at least in idiopathic PD (iPD), the exposure to toxic environmental substances could play an important role in its aetiology.","Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, Environmental toxins, Gene-environment interactions, Braak’s staging and pathology progression"

Recent studies have, therefore, focused on the role of environmental exposure in progression of such diseases especially in the context of prenatal and postnatal life, explaining how molecular mechanisms mediate epigenetic changes leading to degenerative diseases. This review summarizes both the animal and human studies describing various environmental stimuli to which an individual or an animal is exposed during in-utero and postnatal period and mechanisms that promote neurodegeneration. The SNPs mediating gene environment interaction are also described.

"Chronic treatment with anesthetic propofol attenuates β-amyloid protein levels in brain tissues of aged mice","Yiying Zhang, Haijun Shao, Yuanlin Dong, Celeste A Swain & Zhongcong Xie","Zhongcong Xie","zxie@mgh.harvard.edu","11 April 2014","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. At the present time, however, AD still lacks effective treatments. Our recent studies showed that chronic treatment with anesthetic propofol attenuated brain caspase-3 activation and improved cognitive function in aged mice. Accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) is a major component of the neuropathogenesis of AD dementia and cognitive impairment. We therefore set out to determine the effects of chronic treatment with propofol on Aβ levels in brain tissues of aged mice. Propofol (50 mg/kg) was administrated to aged (18 month-old) wild-type mice once a week for 8 weeks. The brain tissues of mice were harvested one day after the final propofol treatment. The harvested brain tissues were then subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis. Here we report that the propofol treatment reduced Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) levels in the brain tissues of the aged mice. Moreover, the propofol treatment decreased the levels of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (the enzyme for Aβ generation), and increased the levels of neprilysin (the enzyme for Aβ degradation) in the brain tissues of the aged mice. These results suggested that the chronic treatment with propofol might reduce brain Aβ levels potentially via decreasing brain levels of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme, thus decreasing Aβ generation; and via increasing brain neprilysin levels, thus increasing Aβ degradation. These preliminary findings from our pilot studies have established a system and postulated a new hypothesis for future research.","Aging, Alzheimer’s disease, Neurodegeneration, β-amyloid peptide, Anesthesia, Propofol"

AD is characterized by progressive and gradual decline in cognitive function and memory loss. While familial early-onset AD is usually associated with gene mutations, the etiology of sporadic late-onset form of AD is largely unknown. It has been reported that environmental factors and epigenetic alterations significantly contribute to the process of AD. Our previous studies have documented that chronic hypoxia is one of the environmental factors that may trigger the AD development and aggravate the disease progression. In this review, we will summarize the pathological effects of chronic hypoxia on the onset and development of AD and put forward the possible molecule mechanisms underlying the chronic hypoxia mediated AD pathogenesis.

Although heavily investigated, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of tauopathies have yet to be fully understood. In this context, several rodent models have been developed that successfully recapitulate the behavioral and neurochemical features of tau pathology, aiming to achieve a better understanding of the link between tau and neurodegeneration. To date, behavioral and biochemical parameters assessed using these models have been conducted using a combination of memory tasks and invasive methods such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or post-mortem analysis. Recently, several novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals targeting tau tangles have been developed, allowing for non-invasive in vivo quantification of tau pathology. Combined with tau transgenic models and microPET, these tracers hold the promise of advancing the development of theoretical models and advancing our understanding of the natural history of AD and non-AD tauopathies. In this review, we briefly describe some of the most important insights for understanding the biological basis of tau pathology, and shed light on the opportunity for improved modeling of tau pathology using a combination of tau-radiopharmaceuticals and animal models.","Positron emission tomography, Tau molecular agents, Tau rodent models, Tauopathies"
"The effects of exercise on cognition in Parkinson’s disease: a systematic review","Danielle K Murray, Matthew A Sacheli & A Jon Stoessl","Danielle K Murray","danielle.k.murray@gmail.com","24 February 2014","Cognitive impairments are highly prevalent in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and can substantially affect a patient’s quality of life. These impairments remain difficult to manage with current clinical therapies, but exercise has been identified as a possible treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to accumulate and analyze evidence for the effects of exercise on cognition in both animal models of PD and human disease. This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Fourteen original reports were identified, including six pre-clinical animal studies and eight human clinical studies. These studies used various exercise interventions and evaluated many different outcome measures; therefore, only a qualitative synthesis was performed. The evidence from animal studies supports the role of exercise to improve cognition in humans through the promotion of neuronal proliferation, neuroprotection and neurogenesis. These findings warrant more research to determine what roles these neural mechanisms play in clinical populations. The reports on cognitive changes in clinical studies demonstrate that a range of exercise programs can improve cognition in humans. While each clinical study demonstrated improvements in a marker of cognition, there were limitations in each study, including non-randomized designs and risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used and the quality of the evidence for human studies were rated from “low” to “moderate” and the strength of the recommendations were rated from “weak” to “strong”. Studies that assessed executive function, compared to general cognitive abilities, received a higher GRADE rating. Overall, this systematic review found that in animal models exercise results in behavioral and corresponding neurobiological changes in the basal ganglia related to cognition. The clinical studies showed that various types of exercise, including aerobic, resistance and dance can improve cognitive function, although the optimal type, amount, mechanisms, and duration of exercise are unclear. With growing support for exercise to improve not only motor symptoms, but also cognitive impairments in PD, health care providers and policy makers should recommend exercise as part of routine management and neurorehabilitation for this disorder.","Parkinson’s disease, Exercise, Cognition, Humans, Animals"
"Regulation of Myelination in the Central Nervous System by Nuclear Lamin B1 and Non-coding RNAs","Shu-Ting Lin, Mary Y Heng, Louis J Ptáček & Ying-Hui Fu","Ying-Hui Fu","ying-hui.fu@ucsf.edu","05 February 2014","Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a progressive and fatal hereditary demyelination disorder characterized initially by autonomic dysfunction and loss of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Majority of ADLD is caused by a genomic duplication of the nuclear lamin B1 gene (LMNB1) encoding lamin B1 protein, resulting in increased gene dosage in brain tissue. In vitro, excessive lamin B1 at the cellular level reduces transcription of myelin genes, leading to premature arrest of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Murine models of ADLD overexpressing LMNB1 exhibited age-dependent motor deficits and myelin defects, which are associated with reduced occupancy of the Yin Yang 1 transcription factor at the promoter region of the proteolipid protein gene. Lamin B1 overexpression mediates oligodendrocyte cell-autonomous neuropathology in ADLD and suggests lamin B1 as an important regulator of myelin formation and maintenance during aging. Identification of microRNA-23 (miR-23) as a negative regulator of lamin B1 can ameliorate the consequences of excessive lamin B1 at the cellular level. miR-23a-overexpressing mice display enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin synthesis. miR-23a targets include a protein coding transcript PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10), and a long noncoding RNA (2700046G09Rik), indicating a unique role for miR-23a in the coordination of proteins and noncoding RNAs in generating and maintaining healthy myelin. Here, we provide a concise review of the current literature on clinical presentations of ADLD and how lamin B1 affects myelination and other developmental processes. Moreover, we address the emerging role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in modulating gene networks, specifically investigating miR-23 as a potential target for the treatment of ADLD and other demyelinating disorders.","Lamin, Long non-coding RNA, MicroRNA, Myelin"

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and painless method to stimulate the human brain. Single- and paired-pulse TMS paradigms are powerful ways to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Motor evoked potential studied with single-pulse TMS is increased in PD, AD and ALS, but is decreased in HD. Changes in motor cortical excitability in neurodegenerative diseases may be related to functional deficits in cortical circuits or to compensatory mechanisms. Reduction or even absence of short interval intracortical inhibition induced by paired-pulse TMS is common in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that there are functional impairments of inhibitory cortical circuits. Decreased short latency afferent inhibition in AD, PD and HD may be related to the cortical cholinergic deficits in these conditions. Cortical plasticity tested by paired associative stimulation or theta burst stimulation is impaired in PD, AD and HD. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) refers to the application of trains of regularly repeating TMS pulses. High-frequency facilitatory rTMS may improve motor symptoms in PD patients whereas low-frequency inhibitory stimulation is a potential treatment for levodopa induced dyskinesia. rTMS delivered both to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improves memory in AD patients. Supplementary motor cortical stimulation in low frequency may be useful for HD patients. However, the effects of treatment with multiple sessions of rTMS for neurodegenerative diseases need to be tested in large, sham-controlled studies in the future before they can be adopted for routine clinical practice.","Alzheimer’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Transcranial magnetic stimulation"

Chronic neuroinflammation is one of the hallmarks of PD pathophysiology. Post-mortem analyses of human PD patients and experimental animal studies indicate that activation of glial cells and increases in pro-inflammatory factor levels are common features of the PD brain. Chronic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated astrocytes and microglia leads to the exacerbation of DA neuron degeneration in the SNpc. Besides, peripheral immune system is also implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Infiltration and accumulation of immune cells from the periphery are detected in and around the affected brain regions of PD patients. Moreover, inflammatory processes have been suggested as promising interventional targets for PD and even other neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the role of inflammation in PD will provide new insights into the pathological processes and help to establish effective therapeutic strategies.

In addition, autophagosomes execute autophagy, which delivers intracellular contents to the lysosome. Maturation of endosomes and/or autophagosomes into a lysosome creates an unique acidic environment within the cell for proteolysis and recycling of unneeded cellular components into usable amino acids and other biomolecular building blocks. In the endocytic pathway, gradual maturation of endosomes into a lysosome and acidification of the late endosome are accompanied by vesicle trafficking, protein sorting and targeted degradation of some sorted cargo. Two opposing sorting systems are operating in these processes: the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) supports targeted degradation and the retromer supports retrograde retrieval of certain cargo. The endosomal-lysosomal system is emerging as a central player in a host of neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating potential roles which are likely to be revealed in pathogenesis and for viable therapeutic strategies. Here we focus on the physiological process of endosomal-lysosomal maturation, acidification and sorting systems along the endocytic pathway, and further discuss relationships between abnormalities in the endosomal-lysosomal system and neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD).","The endosomal-lysosomal system, Neurodegeneration, Acidification, ESCRT, Retromer, Alzheimer’s disease"

These centre on a loss of drug effect (‘wearing off’) with disease progression, the occurrence of dyskinesia, notably with L-dopa use and the appearance of non-motor symptoms that are largely refractory to dopaminergic medication. Treatment strategies in late PD have been dominated by the use of drug combinations and the subtle manipulation of drug dosage. However, change is occurring as the understanding of the basis of motor complications and fluctuations and non-motor symptoms improves. New pharmacological options are expanding with the advent of longer acting versions of existing dopaminergic drugs, new drug delivery systems and the introduction of non-dopaminergic agents able to manipulate motor function both within the basal ganglia and in other brain regions. Non-dopaminergic agents are also being investigated for the treatment of dyskinesia and for the relief of non-motor symptoms.

Additionally, it is rather challenging to differentiate PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD). Clinially-available 3T conventional MRI contributes little to solve these problems. The pathologic alterations of parkinsonism show abnormal brain iron deposition, and therefore susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which is sensitive to iron concentration, has been applied to find iron-related lesions for the diagnosis and differentiation of PD in recent decades. Until now, the majority of research has revealed that in SWI the signal intensity changes in deep brain nuclei, such as the SN, the putamen (PUT), the globus pallidus (GP), the thalamus (TH), the red nucleus (RN) and the caudate nucleus (CN), thereby raising the possibility of early diagnosis and differentiation. Furthermore, the signal changes in SN, PUT and TH sub-regions may settle the issues with higher accuracy.

Although the cause of PD is still unclear, the remarkable advances have been made in understanding the possible causative mechanisms of PD pathogenesis. Numerous studies showed that dysfunction of mitochondria may play key roles in DA neuronal loss. Both genetic and environmental factors that are associated with PD contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and PD pathogenesis. The induction of PD by neurotoxins that inhibit mitochondrial complex I provides direct evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction to PD. Decrease of mitochondrial complex I activity is present in PD brain and in neurotoxin- or genetic factor-induced PD cellular and animal models. Moreover, PINK1 and parkin, two autosomal recessive PD gene products, have important roles in mitophagy, a cellular process to clear damaged mitochondria.

While the etiology of AD remains an enigma, excessive accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is widely believed to induce pathological changes and cause dementia in brains of AD patients. BACE1 was discovered to initiate the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the β-secretase site. Only after this cleavage does γ-secretase further cleave the BACE1-cleaved C-terminal APP fragment to release Aβ. Hence, blocking BACE1 proteolytic activity will suppress Aβ generation. Due to the linkage of Aβ to the potential cause of AD, extensive discovery and development efforts have been directed towards potent BACE1 inhibitors for AD therapy. With the recent breakthrough in developing brain-penetrable BACE1 inhibitors, targeting amyloid deposition-mediated pathology for AD therapy has now become more practical. This review will summarize various strategies that have successfully led to the discovery of BACE1 drugs, such as MK8931, AZD-3293, JNJ-54861911, E2609 and CNP520.

However, the lack of efficient means to deliver BDNF into the body imposes an insurmountable hurdle to its clinical application. To address this challenge, we initiated a cell-based drug screening to search for small molecules that act as the TrkB agonist. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is our first reported small molecular TrkB agonist, which has now been extensively validated in various biochemical and cellular systems. Though binding to the extracellular domain of TrkB, 7,8-DHF triggers TrkB dimerization to induce the downstream signaling.

Recent studies reveal that PINK1 translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane in response to mitochondrial depolarization and phosphorylates ubiquitin at the residue Ser65. The phosphorylated ubiquitin serves as a signal for activating parkin and recruiting autophagy receptors to promote clearance of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. Emerging evidence has begun to indicate a link between impaired ubiquitin phosphorylation-dependent mitophagy and PD pathogenesis and supports the potential of Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin as a biomarker for PD. The new mechanistic insights and phenotypic screens have identified multiple potential therapeutic targets for PD drug discovery. This review highlights recent advances in understanding ubiquitin phosphorylation in mitochondrial quality control and PD pathogenesis and discusses how these findings can be translated into novel approaches for PD diagnostic and therapeutic development.","Mitophagy, Parkinson’s disease, PINK1, Parkin, Ubiquitin-protein ligase, Ubiquitin phosphorylation, Mitochondrial quality control, Mitophagy"

Symptoms of the disease manifest in middle age and include chorea, dystonia, and cognitive decline. Typical latency from diagnosis to death is 20 years. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies available to HD patients. RNAi is a potentially curative therapy for HD. A popular line of research employs siRNA or antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) to knock down mutant Huntingtin mRNA (mHTT). Unfortunately, this modality requires repeated dosing, commonly exhibit off target effects (OTEs), and exert renal and hepatic toxicity. In contrast, a single AAV-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) dose can last years with low toxicity. In addition, we highlight research indicating that shRNA elicits fewer OTEs than siRNA when tested head-to-head. Despite this promise, shRNA therapy has been held back by difficulties controlling expression (oversaturating cells with toxic levels of RNA construct). In this review, we compare RNAi modalities for HD and propose novel methods of optimizing shRNA expression and on-target fidelity.","RNAi, shRNA, siRNA, Huntington’s disease, Off-target effects, Huntingtin, Silencing"

The most commonly used treatments for PD are only partially or transiently effective and are available or applicable to a minority of patients. Because, these therapies neither restore the lost or degenerated dopaminergic neurons, nor prevent or delay the disease progression, the need for more effective therapeutics is critical.

It does not take into account the disease etiology or the highly variable clinical course even amongst patients diagnosed with the same disorder. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for a system-wide, unbiased approach to identify all gene variants in the genome simultaneously. With the plethora of new genes being identified, genetic rather than phenotype-based classification of Mendelian diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) has become widely accepted. It has also become clear that gene variants play a role in common and predominantly sporadic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The observation of pleiotropy has emerged, with mutations in the same gene giving rise to diverse phenotypes, which further increases the complexity of phenotype-genotype correlation. Possible mechanisms of pleiotropy include different downstream effects of different mutations in the same gene, presence of modifier genes, and oligogenic inheritance. Future directions include development of bioinformatics tools and establishment of more extensive public genotype/phenotype databases to better distinguish deleterious gene variants from benign polymorphisms, translation of genetic findings into pathogenic mechanisms through in-vitro and in-vivo studies, and ultimately finding disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.","Next generation sequencing, Neurodegenerative diseases, Genetics, Pleiotropy"

This hallmark pathologies of AD are the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Although the exact etiology of AD remains a mystery, studies over the past 30 have shown that abnormal generation or accumulation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) is likely to be a predominant early event in AD pathological development. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) via proteolytic cleavage by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Chemical inhibition of BACE1 has been shown to reduce Aβ in animal studies and in human trials. While BACE1 inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials to treat AD patients, it is highly important to understand whether BACE1 inhibition will significantly impact cognitive functions in AD patients. This review summarizes the recent studies on BACE1 synaptic functions.

However clinical prevention and treatment of the disease is very difficult because of its occult onset and severity of the symptoms. In recent years, many anti-amyloid β immunotherapies have not demonstrated clinical efficacy in subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the failure may be due to the deposition of Aβ in the cerebrovascular export pathway resulting in further damage to blood vessels and aggravating CAA. So decreased clearance of Aβ in blood vessels plays a crucial role in the development of CAA and AD, and identification of the molecular pathways involved will provide new targets for treatment. In this review, we mainly describe the mechanisms of Aβ clearance through vessels, especially in terms of some proteins and receptors involved in this process.","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, Amyloid β-protein, Clearance"

In addition to the acute risk of morbidity with moderate to severe injuries, traumatic brain injury is associated with a number of chronic neurological and neuropsychiatric sequelae including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. However, despite the high incidence of traumatic brain injuries and the established clinical correlation with neurodegeneration, the causative factors linking these processes have not yet been fully elucidated. Apart from removal from activity, few, if any prophylactic treatments against post-traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration exist. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and neurodegeneration in order to identify potential factors that initiate neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic excitotoxicity have previously been implicated in both secondary brain injury and neurodegeneration. In particular, reactive oxygen species appear to be key in mediating molecular insult in neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity. As such, it is likely that post injury oxidative stress is a key mechanism which links traumatic brain injury to increased risk of neurodegeneration. Consequently, reactive oxygen species and their subsequent byproducts may serve as novel fluid markers for identification and monitoring of cellular damage. Furthermore, these reactive species may further serve as a suitable therapeutic target to reduce the risk of post-injury neurodegeneration and provide long term quality of life improvements for those suffering from traumatic brain injury.","Traumatic brain injury, Neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Oxidative stress, Reactive oxygen species"

However, previous clinical trials yield controversial results regarding nicotine treatment. In this review, we updated epidemiological, preclinical and clinical data, and studies on nicotine from diet. We also reviewed interactions between genetic factors and cigarette smoking.

However, other studies failed to confirm this. It seems not clear what determines the difference in response to LFS. Differences in study design, such as presence or absence of FOG, exact LFS used (60 Hz versus 80 Hz), study size, open label versus randomized double blind assessment, retrospective versus prospective evaluation, medication On or Off state, total electric energy delivered maintained or not with the change in frequency, and the location of active contacts could all potentially affect the results. This mini-review goes over the literature with the aforementioned factors in mind, focusing on the effect of LFS versus HFS on FOG and other axial symptoms in PD with bilateral STN DBS, in an effort to extract the essential data to guide our clinical management of axial symptoms and explore the potential underlying mechanisms as well. Overall, LFS of 60 Hz seems to be consistently effective in patients with FOG at the usual HFS in regards to improving FOG, speech, swallowing function and other axial symptoms, though LFS could reduce tremor control in some patients.

Today, Parkinson’s disease represents the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with an estimated global prevalence of over 10 million. Conversely, atypical parkinsonian syndromes encompass a group of relatively heterogeneous disorders that may share some clinical features with Parkinson’s disease, but are uncommon distinct clinicopathological diseases. Decades of scientific advancements have vastly improved our understanding of these disorders, including improvements in in vivo imaging for biomarker identification. Multimodal imaging for the visualization of structural and functional brain changes is especially important, as it allows a ‘window’ into the underlying pathophysiological abnormalities. In this article, we first present an overview of the cardinal clinical and neuropathological features of, 1) synucleinopathies: Parkinson’s disease and other Lewy body spectrum disorders, as well as multiple system atrophy, and 2) tauopathies: progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. A comprehensive presentation of well-established and emerging imaging biomarkers for each disorder are then discussed. Biomarkers for the following imaging modalities are reviewed: 1) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T1, T2, and susceptibility-weighted sequences for volumetric and voxel-based morphometric analyses, as well as MRI derived visual signatures, 2) diffusion tensor MRI for the assessment of white matter tract injury and microstructural integrity, 3) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for quantifying proton-containing brain metabolites, 4) single photon emission computed tomography for the evaluation of nigrostriatal integrity (as assessed by presynaptic dopamine transporters and postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors), and cerebral perfusion, 5) positron emission tomography for gauging nigrostriatal functions, glucose metabolism, amyloid and tau molecular imaging, as well as neuroinflammation, 6) myocardial scintigraphy for dysautonomia, and 7) transcranial sonography for measuring substantia nigra and lentiform nucleus echogenicity. Imaging biomarkers, using the ‘multimodal approach’, may aid in making early, accurate and objective diagnostic decisions, highlight neuroanatomical and pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as assist in evaluating disease progression and therapeutic responses to drugs in clinical trials.","Biomarkers, Parkinson’s disease, Atypical parkinsonian syndrome, MRI, PET, SPECT, Diffusion tensor imaging, Molecular imaging, Myocardial scintigraphy, Transcranial sonography"

Prodromal stage of the disease, during which the disease pathology has started but is insufficient to result in clinical manifestations, offers a valuable window for disease-modifying therapies. The most focused underlying mechanisms linking the pathological pattern and clinical characteristics of prodromal PD are the prion hypothesis of alpha-synuclein and the selective vulnerability of neurons. In this review, we consider the two potential portals, the vagus nerve and the olfactory bulb, through which abnormal alpha-synuclein can access the brain. We review the clinical, pathological and neuroimaging evidence of the parasympathetic nervous system and the olfactory system in the neurodegenerative process and using the two systems as models to discuss the internal homogeneity and heterogeneity of the prodromal stage of PD, including both the clustering and subtyping of symptoms and signs. Finally, we offer some suggestions on future directions for imaging studies in prodromal Parkinson’s disease.","Parkinson’s disease, Prodromal, Alpha-synuclein, Parasympathetic nervous system, Olfactory system, Subtype"

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and characterized by two types of lesions: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that exosomes are associated with amyloid precursor (APP) and Tau proteins and play a controversial role in Alzheimer’s disease process.

In this review, we will summarize different techniques, diverse clinical trials, and the mechanisms of MT as it is helpful to the cognition in AD, providing reference for future research. Many articles have demonstrated that MT can reduce cognitive decline especially in autobiographical and episodic memories, psychomotor speed, executive function domains, and global cognition. MT is a promising intervention for strategy of dementia especially of AD and it must be started as early as possible. However, more evidences with prospective, randomized, blinded, uniform and rigorous methodological investigations are needed.

Abnormal endogenous opioid signal transduction pathways in basal ganglia have been well documented in LID. Opioid receptors have been targeted to alleviate the dyskinesia. However, the exact role of this altered opioid activity is remains under active investigation.

Their widespread use heightens the importance of careful consideration of their varied effects on the body. Although randomized controlled trials have not confirmed cognitive impairing effects with statins, continuing evidence suggests statins have the ability to cause reversible cognitive impairment in some patients. Paradoxically, statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and improve cognitive impairment in some cases. However, randomized controlled trials have similarly failed to find the beneficial effect. Supporting evidence for both claims is compelling whereas known limitations of the clinical trials may explain the lack of findings. This narrative review aims to explain why there is still controversy and how both effects can, and may, be possible. The mechanisms that have been hypothesized for each effect are seemingly independent from one another and may explain the contradicting results. Being mindful of the complex effects of statins, health care providers need to be able to identify patients who are at risk for or already experiencing cognitive impairment from statin use while also identifying those who could potentially decrease their risk of dementia with statins.","Statin, Cognition, Dementia, Memory, Cholesterol, Alzheimer’s disease, Vascular dementia, Neuroprotection"

In addition, adult neurogenesis might also play a role in mood and affective disorders. The factors that regulate adult neurogenesis have been broadly studied. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of regulating neurogenesis are still not fully defined.

The detailed pathogenic mechanisms underlying the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD are unclear, and no drugs or treatments have been developed to alleviate progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD. However, the formation of α-synuclein-positive protein aggregates in Lewy body has been identified as a common pathological feature of PD, possibly stemming from the consequence of protein misfolding and dysfunctional proteostasis. Proteostasis is the mechanism for maintaining protein homeostasis via modulation of protein translation, enhancement of chaperone capacity and the prompt clearance of misfolded protein by the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. Deregulated protein translation and impaired capacities of chaperone or protein degradation can disturb proteostasis processes, leading to pathological protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in PD.

Several brain stimulation techniques are currently available to assess or modulate human neuroplasticity, which could offer clinically useful interventions as well as quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this review, we discuss several brain stimulation techniques, with a special emphasis on transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS), and review the results of clinical studies that applied these techniques to examine or modulate impaired neuroplasticity at the local and network levels in patients with AD or PD. The impaired neuroplasticity can be detected in patients at the earlier and later stages of both neurodegenerative diseases. However, current brain stimulation techniques, with a notable exception of DBS for PD treatment, cannot serve as adequate clinical tools to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis of individual patients with AD or PD.

Microglia and astrocytes are key regulators of inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. The activation of microglia and astrocytes is heterogeneous and traditionally categorized as neurotoxic (M1-phenotype microglia and A1-phenotype astrocytes) or neuroprotective (M2-phenotype microglia and A2-phenotype astrocytes). However, this dichotomized classification may not reflect the various phenotypes of microglia and astrocytes. The relationship between these activated glial cells is also very complicated, and the phenotypic distribution can change, based on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the roles of microglia and astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases is essential for developing effective therapies. In this review, we discuss the roles of inflammatory response in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on the contributions of microglia and astrocytes and their relationship. In addition, we discuss biomarkers to measure neuroinflammation and studies on therapeutic drugs that can modulate neuroinflammation.","Neuroinflammation, Neurodegenerative diseases, Microglia, Astrocytes"

"Maintaining the balance of TDP-43, mitochondria, and autophagy: a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases","Chunhui Huang & Zaijun Zhang","Sen Yan, Zaijun Zhang","231yansen@163.com, zaijunzhang@163.com","30 October 2020","Mitochondria are the energy center of cell operations and are involved in physiological functions and maintenance of metabolic balance and homeostasis in the body. Alterations of mitochondrial function are associated with a variety of degenerative and acute diseases. As mitochondria age in cells, they gradually become inefficient and potentially toxic. Acute injury can trigger the permeability of mitochondrial membranes, which can lead to apoptosis or necrosis. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a protein widely present in cells. It can bind to RNA, regulate a variety of RNA processes, and play a role in the formation of multi-protein/RNA complexes. Thus, the normal physiological functions of TDP-43 are particularly important for cell survival. Normal TDP-43 is located in various subcellular structures including mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated membrane, RNA particles and stress granules to regulate the endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondrial binding, mitochondrial protein translation, and mRNA transport and translation. Importantly, TDP-43 is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, which are characterized by abnormal phosphorylation, ubiquitination, lysis or nuclear depletion of TDP-43 in neurons and glial cells. Although the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathy remains unknown, the presence of pathological TDP-43 inside or outside of mitochondria and the functional involvement of TDP-43 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, transport, and function suggest that mitochondria are associated with TDP-43-related diseases. Autophagy is a basic physiological process that maintains the homeostasis of cells, including targeted clearance of abnormally aggregated proteins and damaged organelles in the cytoplasm; therefore, it is considered protective against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the combination of abnormal TDP-43 aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insufficient autophagy can lead to a variety of aging-related pathologies. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on the associations of mitochondria with TDP-43 and the role of autophagy in the clearance of abnormally aggregated TDP-43 and dysfunctional mitochondria. Finally, we discuss a novel approach for neurodegenerative treatment based on the knowledge.","TDP-43, Mitochondria, Autophagy/mitophagy, Neurodegeneration"

The age of onset, rate of disease progression and the precise profile of motor and non-motor symptoms display considerable individual variation. Neuropathologically, the loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons is a key feature of PD. The vast majority of PD patients exhibit alpha-synuclein aggregates in several brain regions, but there is also great variability in the neuropathology between individuals. While the dopamine replacement therapies can reduce motor symptoms, current therapies do not modify the disease progression. Numerous clinical trials using a wide variety of approaches have failed to achieve disease modification. It has been suggested that the heterogeneity of PD is a major contributing factor to the failure of disease modification trials, and that it is unlikely that a single treatment will be effective in all patients. Precision medicine, using drugs designed to target the pathophysiology in a manner that is specific to each individual with PD, has been suggested as a way forward. PD patients can be stratified according to whether they carry one of the risk variants associated with elevated PD risk. In this review we assess current clinical trials targeting two enzymes, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and glucocerebrosidase (GBA), which are encoded by two most common PD risk genes. Because the details of the pathogenic processes coupled to the different LRRK2 and GBA risk variants are not fully understood, we ask if these precision medicine-based intervention strategies will prove “precise” or “personalized” enough to modify the disease process in PD patients. We also consider at what phases of the disease that such strategies might be effective, in light of the genes being primarily associated with the risk of developing disease in the first place, and less clearly linked to the rate of disease progression. Finally, we critically evaluate the notion that therapies targeting LRRK2 and GBA might be relevant to a wider segment of PD patients, beyond those that actually carry risk variants of these genes.","Parkinson’s disease, Precision medicine, Personalized medicine, Glucocerebrosidase, GCase, Leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, Dopamine, PD drug trials, PD risk variants"

The present review focuses on the associations between PD and serum vitamin D levels by reviewing studies on the associations of PD with serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. We found that PD patients have lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls and that the vitamin D concentrations are negatively correlated with PD risk and severity. Furthermore, higher vitamin D concentrations are linked to better cognitive function and mood in PD patients. Findings on the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of PD are inconsistent, but the FokI (C/T) polymorphism is significantly linked with PD. The occurrence of FokI (C/T) gene polymorphism may influence the risk, severity, and cognitive ability of PD patients, while also possibly influencing the effect of Vitamin D3 supplementation in PD patients. In view of the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D and the close association between vitamin D and dopaminergic neurotransmission, interventional prospective studies on vitamin D supplementation in PD patients should be conducted in the future.","Parkinson’s disease, Vitamin D, VDR gene polymorphisms, Vitamin D3 supplementation, Neuroprotective, Dopaminergic neurotransmission"

Increasing numbers of genes are found to be associated with ALS; among those, the first identified gene, SOD1 coding a Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase protein (SOD1), has been regarded as the gold standard in the research on a pathomechanism of ALS. Abnormal accumulation of misfolded SOD1 in affected spinal motor neurons has been established as a pathological hallmark of ALS caused by mutations in SOD1 (SOD1-ALS). Nonetheless, involvement of wild-type SOD1 remains quite controversial in the pathology of ALS with no SOD1 mutations (non-SOD1 ALS), which occupies more than 90% of total ALS cases. In vitro studies have revealed post-translationally controlled misfolding and aggregation of wild-type as well as of mutant SOD1 proteins; therefore, SOD1 proteins could be a therapeutic target not only in SOD1-ALS but also in more prevailing cases, non-SOD1 ALS. In order to search for evidence on misfolding and aggregation of wild-type SOD1 in vivo, we reviewed pathological studies using mouse models and patients and then summarized arguments for and against possible involvement of wild-type SOD1 in non-SOD1 ALS as well as in SOD1-ALS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, Protein misfolding"

Their etiologies are idiopathic, and treatments are symptomatic and orientated towards cognitive or motor deficits. Neuropathologically, both are proteinopathies with pathological aggregates (plaques of amyloid-β peptide and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein in Alzheimer’s disease, and Lewy bodies mostly composed of α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease). These deposits appear in the nervous system in a predictable and accumulative sequence with six neuropathological stages. Both disorders present a long prodromal period, characterized by preclinical signs including hyposmia. Interestingly, the olfactory system, particularly the anterior olfactory nucleus, is initially and preferentially affected by the pathology. Cerebral atrophy revealed by magnetic resonance imaging must be complemented by histological analyses to ascertain whether neuronal and/or glial loss or neuropil remodeling are responsible for volumetric changes. It has been proposed that these proteinopathies could act in a prion-like manner in which a misfolded protein would be able to force native proteins into pathogenic folding (seeding), which then propagates through neurons and glia (spreading). Existing data have been examined to establish why some neuronal populations are vulnerable while others are resistant to pathology and to what extent glia prevent and/or facilitate proteinopathy spreading. Connectomic approaches reveal a number of hubs in the olfactory system (anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory entorhinal cortex and cortical amygdala) that are key interconnectors with the main hubs (the entorhinal–hippocampal–cortical and amygdala–dorsal motor vagal nucleus) of network dysfunction in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.","α-Synuclein, Amyloid-β, Anterior olfactory nucleus, hyposmia, Tau protein"

Recent studies found that Aβ clearance in the periphery contributes substantially to reducing Aβ accumulation in the brain. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of how Aβ is cleared in the periphery is important for the development of effective therapies for AD. In this review, we summarized recent findings on the mechanisms of Aβ efflux from the brain to the periphery and discuss where and how the brain-derived Aβ is cleared in the periphery. Based on these findings, we propose future strategies to enhance peripheral Aβ clearance for the prevention and treatment of AD.

The disease severity warrants urgent development of disease-modifying therapy, but the disease pathogenesis is still enigmatic. Neurodegeneration in MSA brains is preceded by the emergence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), which are insoluble α-synuclein accumulations within oligodendrocytes (OLGs). Thus, preventive strategies against GCI formation may suppress disease progression. However, although numerous studies have tried to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of GCI formation, difficulty remains in understanding the pathological interaction between the two pivotal aspects of GCIs; α-synuclein and OLGs. The difficulty originates from several enigmas: 1) what triggers the initial generation and possible propagation of pathogenic α-synuclein species? 2) what contributes to OLG-specific accumulation of α-synuclein, which is abundantly expressed in neurons but not in OLGs? and 3) how are OLGs and other glial cells affected and contribute to neurodegeneration? The primary pathogenesis of GCIs may involve myelin dysfunction and dyshomeostasis of the oligodendroglial cellular environment such as autophagy and iron metabolism. We have previously reported that oligodendrocyte precursor cells are more prone to develop intracellular inclusions in the presence of extracellular fibrillary α-synuclein. This finding implies a possibility that the propagation of GCI pathology in MSA brains is mediated through the internalization of pathological α-synuclein into oligodendrocyte precursor cells. In this review, in order to discuss the pathogenesis of GCIs, we will focus on the composition of neuronal and oligodendroglial inclusions in synucleinopathies. Furthermore, we will introduce some hypotheses on how α-synuclein pathology spreads among OLGs in MSA brains, in the light of our data from the experiments with primary oligodendrocyte lineage cell culture. While various reports have focused on the mysterious source of α-synuclein in GCIs, insights into the mechanism which regulates the uptake of pathological α-synuclein into oligodendroglial cells may yield the development of the disease-modifying therapy for MSA. The interaction between glial cells and α-synuclein is also highlighted with previous studies of post-mortem human brains, cultured cells, and animal models, which provide comprehensive insight into GCIs and the MSA pathomechanisms.","Multiple system atrophy, α-Synuclein, Glial cytoplasmic inclusion, Prion, Neurodegeneration, Oligodendrocyte, Microglia, Astrocyte, Oligodendrocyte precursor cell"

In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of basal ganglia-thalamocortical networks has emerged as a promising intervention for refractory TS with or without psychiatric comorbidities. Three major challenges need to be addressed to move the field of DBS treatment for TS forward: (1) patient and DBS target selection, (2) ethical concerns with treating pediatric patients, and (3) DBS treatment optimization and improvement of individual patient outcomes (motor and phonic tics, as well as functioning and quality of life).

Gorecki","anastazja.gorecki@research.uwa.edu.au","17 November 2021","Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable, devastating disorder that is characterized by pathological protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. In recent years, growing evidence has implicated the gut environment and the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, especially in a subset of people who exhibit prodromal gastrointestinal dysfunction. Specifically, perturbations of gut homeostasis are hypothesized to contribute to α-synuclein aggregation in enteric neurons, which may spread to the brain over decades and eventually result in the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of PD, including neurodegeneration and motor impairments. However, the mechanisms linking gut disturbances and α-synuclein aggregation are still unclear. A plethora of research indicates that toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, are critical mediators of gut homeostasis. Alongside their established role in innate immunity throughout the body, studies are increasingly demonstrating that TLR2 and TLR4 signalling shapes the development and function of the gut and the enteric nervous system. Notably, TLR2 and TLR4 are dysregulated in patients with PD, and may thus be central to early gut dysfunction in PD. To better understand the putative contribution of intestinal TLR2 and TLR4 dysfunction to early α-synuclein aggregation and PD, we critically discuss the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in normal gut function as well as evidence for altered TLR2 and TLR4 signalling in PD, by reviewing clinical, animal model and in vitro research. Growing evidence on the immunological aetiology of α-synuclein aggregation is also discussed, with a focus on the interactions of α-synuclein with TLR2 and TLR4. We propose a conceptual model of PD pathogenesis in which microbial dysbiosis alters the permeability of the intestinal barrier as well as TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, ultimately leading to a positive feedback loop of chronic gut dysfunction promoting α-synuclein aggregation in enteric and vagal neurons. In turn, α-synuclein aggregates may then migrate to the brain via peripheral nerves, such as the vagal nerve, to contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration typically associated with PD.","Parkinson’s disease, TLR2, TLR4, α-Synuclein, Gut-brain axis, Gut barrier, Gut homeostasis"

The formation of protein aggregates which contain cytoskeletal proteins, and  mitochondrial dysfunction both have devastating effects on the function of neurons and are shared pathological features across several neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington’s disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

Therefore, dysregulations of the cytoskeletal network and  mitochondrial homeostasis and localization, may be common pathways in the initial steps of neurodegeneration.

Accumulating evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction could be an early pathological event in AD. Pathological tau, which is detached from axonal microtubules and mislocalized into pre- and postsynaptic neuronal compartments, is suggested to induce synaptic dysfunction in several ways, including reducing mobility and release of presynaptic vesicles, decreasing glutamatergic receptors, impairing the maturation of dendritic spines at postsynaptic terminals, disrupting mitochondrial transport and function in synapses, and promoting the phagocytosis of synapses by microglia. Here, we review the current understanding of how pathological tau mediates synaptic dysfunction and contributes to cognitive decline in AD.

In recent years, astrocytes have attracted considerable attention in the field. Although astrocytes perform a variety of physiological functions in the brain, they are pivotal mediators of α-syn toxicity since they internalize α-syn released from damaged neurons, and this triggers an inflammatory response, protein degradation dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Silva","Francisca Monteiro","id8700@alunos.uminho.pt","24 September 2021","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 40 million people worldwide. The ineffectiveness of the available pharmacological treatments against AD has fostered researchers to focus on alternative strategies to overcome this challenge. Mechanical vibrations delivered in different stimulation modes have been associated with marked improvements in cognitive and physical performance in both demented and non-demented elderly. Some of the mechanical-based stimulation modalities in efforts are earlier whole-body vibration, transcranial ultrasound stimulation with microbubble injection, and more recently, auditory stimulation. However, there is a huge variety of treatment specifications, and in many cases, conflicting results are reported. In this review, a search on Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases was performed, resulting in 37 papers . These studies suggest that mechanical vibrations delivered through different stimulation modes are effective in attenuating many parameters of AD pathology including functional connectivity and neuronal circuit integrity deficits in the brains of AD patients, as well as in subjects with cognitive decline and non-demented older adults. Despite the evolving preclinical and clinical evidence on these therapeutic modalities, their translation into clinical practice is not consolidated yet. Thus, this comprehensive and critical systematic review aims to address the most important gaps in the reviewed protocols and propose optimal regimens for future clinical application.","Alzheimer’s disease, Auditory stimulation, Mechanical vibrations, Ultrasounds, Whole-body vibration"

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism by which the impaired glutamate reuptake causes neuronal hyperactivity remains unclear. Chronic suppression of the glutamate reuptake causes accumulation of ambient glutamate that could diffuse from synaptic sites at the dendrites to the soma to elevate the tonic activation of somatic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). However, less attention has been paid to the potential role of tonic activity change in extrasynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs) located at the neuronal soma on generation of neuronal hyperactivity.","NMDA receptor, Hyperactivity, Somatic modification, Alzheimer’s disease"

Aging-related neurodegeneration is associated with epigenetic alteration, which determines the status of diseases. In recent years, extensive research has shown that physical exercise (PE) can affect the DNAm level, implying a reversal of the epigenetic clock in neurodegeneration. PE also regulates brain plasticity, neuroinflammation, and molecular signaling cascades associated with epigenetics. This review summarizes the effects of PE on neurodegenerative diseases via both general and disease-specific DNAm mechanisms, and discusses epigenetic modifications that alleviate the pathological symptoms of these diseases. This may lead to probing of the underpinnings of neurodegenerative disorders and provide valuable therapeutic references for cognitive and motor dysfunction.","Physical exercise, DNA methylation, Neural mechanism, Neurodegeneration, Motor deficits"

This process is highly regulated and can be highly flexible through a process known as alternative splicing, which allows for several transcripts to arise from a single gene, thereby greatly increasing genetic plasticity and the diversity of proteome. Alternative splicing is particularly prevalent in neuronal cells, where the splicing patterns are continuously changing to maintain cellular homeostasis and promote neurogenesis, migration and synaptic function. The continuous changes in splicing patterns and a high demand on many cis- and trans-splicing factors contribute to the susceptibility of neuronal tissues to splicing defects. The resultant neurodegenerative diseases are a large group of disorders defined by a gradual loss of neurons and a progressive impairment in neuronal function. Several of the most common neurodegenerative diseases involve some form of splicing defect(s), such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and spinal muscular atrophy. Our growing understanding of RNA splicing has led to the explosion of research in the field of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics. Here we review our current understanding of the effects alternative splicing has on neuronal differentiation, neuronal migration, synaptic maturation and regulation, as well as the impact on neurodegenerative diseases. We will also review the current landscape of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides as a therapeutic strategy for a number of common neurodegenerative disorders.","Neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Alternative splicing, Splicing defects, Antisense oligonucleotides, Splice-switching, Disease-modifying treatment"

For the subsequent meta-analysis, study characteristics were extracted and effect sizes were computed. Ten out of 2324 published articles (n = 169 animals) were selected for further meta-analysis. After ADSC therapy, the rotation behavior (10 experiments, n = 156 animals) and rotarod performance (3 experiments, n = 54 animals) were improved (P < 0.000 01 and P = 0.000 3, respectively).

Here, we review the associations between NPS and AD biomarkers amyloid-β (Aβ), tau and neurodegeneration in preclinical AD and cognitively-unimpaired individuals in 19 eligible English-language publications (8 cross-sectional studies, 10 longitudinal, 1 both cross-sectional and longitudinal). The cross-sectional studies have consistently shown that NPS, particularly depressive and anxiety symptoms, are associated with higher Aβ.

However, most of the studies have either cross-sectionally or longitudinally shown no association between NPS and tau pathology.

However, evidence for the association between atrophy and NPS in preclinical AD is less consistent. Therefore, future longitudinal studies with well-designed methodologies and NPS measurements are required not only to determine the relationship among AT(N) biomarkers, NPS and cognitive decline, but also to elucidate the contribution of comorbid pathology to preclinical AD.","Neuropsychiatric symptoms, Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease, Mild behavioral impairment, Amyloid-β, Hyperphosphorylated tau, Neurodegeneration"

These findings provide valuable insights into a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and demonstrate that retinal changes are potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and monitoring of disease progression.","Alzheimer’s disease, Mild cognitive impairment, Optical coherence tomography, Optical coherence tomography angiography, Retina, Biomarkers,

Due to the complication of such a multifactorial disorder and significant limitations of the therapy, numerous genetic approaches have been proved effective in finding out genes and mechanisms implicated in this disease. Following the observation of a higher frequency of PD in Gaucher’s disease (GD), a lysosomal storage condition, mutations of glycosylceramidase beta (GBA) encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase) have been shown to be involved and have been explored in the context of PD. GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor of PD. Various studies have revealed the relationships between PD and GBA gene mutations, facilitating a better understanding of this disorder. Various hypotheses delineate that the pathological mutations of GBA minimize the enzymatic activity of GCase, which affects the proliferation and clearance of α-synuclein; this affects the lysosomal homeostasis, exacerbating the endoplasmic reticulum stress or encouraging the mitochondrial dysfunction. Identification of the pathological mechanisms underlying the GBA-associated parkinsonism (GBA + PD) advances our understanding of PD. This review based on current literature aims to elucidate various genetic and clinical characteristics correlated with GBA mutations and to identify the numerous pathological processes underlying GBA + PD. We also delineate the therapeutic strategies to interfere with the mutant GCase function for further improvement of the related α-synuclein–GCase crosstalks. Moreover, the various therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy, chaperone proteins, and histone deacetylase inhibitors for the treatment of GBA + PD are discussed.","Parkinson’s disease, Glycosylceramidase, Glucocerebrosidase, Gaucher’s disease, Mutations, α-Synuclein"

Forty-six studies covering 17 biochemical indicators, representing 5454 ALS patients and 7986 control subjects, were included in this meta-analysis. Four indicators, including fasting blood glucose level (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.13, 95% CI [0.06–0.21], p = 0.001), serum ferritin level (WMD = 63.42, 95% CI [48.12–78.73], p < 0.001), transferrin saturation coefficient level (WMD = 2.79, 95% CI [1.52–4.05], p < 0.001), and creatine kinase level (WMD = 80.29, 95% CI [32.90–127.67], p < 0.001), were significantly higher in the ALS patients, whereas the total iron-binding capacity (WMD = − 2.42, 95% CI [− 3.93, − 0.90], p = 0.002) was significantly lower in ALS patients than in the control subjects. In contrast, the other 12 candidates did not show significant differences between ALS patients and controls. Moreover, pooled hazard ratios (HR) showed significantly reduced survival (HR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.02–1.88], p = 0.039) of ALS patients with elevated serum ferritin levels. These findings suggest that abnormalities in energy metabolism and disruption of iron homeostasis are involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. In addition, the serum ferritin level is negatively associated with the overall survival of ALS patients.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Biochemical indicators, Energy homeostasis, Iron metabolism, Creatinine kinase"

Mutations in the gene that encodes TDP-43 (TARBDP) are known to result in both familial and sporadic ALS. In ALS, disruption of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) constitutes a critical event in disease pathogenesis, leading to denervation atrophy, motor impairments and disability. Morphological defects and impaired synaptic transmission at NMJs have been reported in several TDP-43 animal models and in vitro, linking TDP-43 dysregulation to the loss of NMJ integrity in ALS. Through the lens of the dying-back and dying-forward hypotheses of ALS, this review discusses the roles of TDP-43 related to synaptic function, with a focus on the potential molecular mechanisms occurring within MNs, skeletal muscles and glial cells that may contribute to NMJ disruption in ALS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Denervation, Neuromuscular junction, TDP-43, Dying-back, Dying-forward"

Motor neuron degeneration is typically caused by a combination of intrinsic neuronal (cell autonomous) defects as well as extrinsic (non-cell autonomous) factors such as astrocyte-mediated toxicity. Astrocytes are highly plastic cells that react to their microenvironment to mediate relevant responses. In neurodegeneration, astrocytes often turn reactive and in turn secrete a slew of factors to exert pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects. Various efforts have been carried out to characterize the diseased astrocyte secretome over the years, revealing that pro-inflammatory chemokines, cytokines and microRNAs are the main players in mediating neuronal death. As metabolomic technologies mature, these studies begin to shed light on neurotoxic metabolites such as secreted lipids. In this focused review, we will discuss changes in the astrocyte secretome during ALS. In particular, we will discuss the components of the reactive astrocyte secretome that contribute to neuronal death in ALS.","Motor neuron disease, Astrocyte, Astrocyte-mediated toxicity, Secretome"

All three strategies are considered examples of continuous dopaminergic stimulation achieved through CDD. A central premise of the CDD is to achieve stable control of the parkinsonian motor and non-motor states and avoid emergence of ‘OFF’ periods. However, data suggest that despite their efficacy in reducing the number and duration of ‘OFF’ periods, these strategies still do not prevent ‘OFF’ periods in the middle to late stages of PD, thus contradicting the widely held concepts of continuous drug delivery and continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Why these emergent ‘OFF’ periods still occur is unknown. In this review, we analyse the potential reasons for their persistence. The contribution of drug- and device-related involvement, and the problems related to site-specific drug delivery are analysed.

Quintanilla","Rodrigo A. Quintanilla","rodrigo.quintanilla@uautonoma.cl","04 July 2022","Neurological disorders (NDs) are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction leading to synaptic failure, cognitive impairment, and motor injury. Among these diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have raised a significant research interest. These disorders present common neuropathological signs, including neuronal dysfunction, protein accumulation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial abnormalities. In this context, mitochondrial impairment is characterized by a deficiency in ATP production, excessive production of reactive oxygen species, calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial transport failure, and mitochondrial dynamics deficiencies. These defects in mitochondrial health could compromise the synaptic process, leading to early cognitive dysfunction observed in these NDs. Interestingly, skin fibroblasts from AD, PD, HD, and ALS patients have been suggested as a useful strategy to investigate and detect early mitochondrial abnormalities in these NDs. In this context, fibroblasts are considered a viable model for studying neurodegenerative changes due to their metabolic and biochemical relationships with neurons. Also, studies of our group and others have shown impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics in fibroblasts from patients diagnosed with sporadic and genetic forms of AD, PD, HD, and ALS. Interestingly, these mitochondrial abnormalities have been observed in the brain tissues of patients suffering from the same pathologies. Therefore, fibroblasts represent a novel strategy to study the genesis and progression of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, PD, HD, and ALS. This review discusses recent evidence that proposes fibroblasts as a potential target to study mitochondrial bioenergetics impairment in neurological disorders and consequently to search for new biomarkers of neurodegeneration.

The neurodegenerative process is mediated by numerous metabolic pathways, most of which lead to apoptosis. In recent years, hydrophilic bile acids, particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), have shown important anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities, with numerous experimental and clinical evidence suggesting their possible therapeutic use as disease-modifiers in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental evidence on the mechanisms underlying TUDCA’s neuroprotective action derives from animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia. Preclinical studies indicate that TUDCA exerts its effects not only by regulating and inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, but also by reducing oxidative stress, protecting the mitochondria, producing an anti-neuroinflammatory action, and acting as a chemical chaperone to maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. Furthermore, data from phase II clinical trials have shown TUDCA to be safe and a potential disease-modifier in ALS. ALS is the first neurodegenerative disease being treated with hydrophilic bile acids. While further clinical evidence is being accumulated for the other diseases, TUDCA stands as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Bile acids, Disease-modifying, Huntington’s disease, Neurodegeneration, Neuroprotection, Parkinson’s disease, Ursodeoxycholic acid, Tauroursodeoxycholic acid"

These diseases involve an intricate pattern of cross-talk between different types of cells to maintain specific signaling pathways. A component of such intercellular cross-talk is the exchange of various types of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes are a subset of EVs, which are increasingly being known for the role they play in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., synucleinopathies and tauopathies. The ability of the central nervous system exosomes to cross the blood–brain barrier into blood has generated enthusiasm in their study as potential biomarkers. However, the lack of standardized, efficient, and ultra-sensitive methods for the isolation and detection of brain-derived exosomes has hampered the development of effective biomarkers. Exosomes mirror heterogeneous biological changes that occur during the progression of these incurable illnesses, potentially offering a more comprehensive outlook of neurodegenerative disease diagnosis, progression and treatment. In this review, we aim to discuss the challenges and opportunities of peripheral biofluid-based brain-exosomes in the diagnosis and biomarker discovery of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In the later part, we discuss the traditional and emerging methods used for the isolation of exosomes and compare their advantages and disadvantages in clinical settings.","Alzheimer’s disease, Central nervous system, Diagnosis, Exosomes, Blood–brain barrier, Parkinson’s disease"

A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted based on the MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO databases. A pooled effect size was calculated by odds ratio (OR) and standard mean difference (SMD). Forty studies were selected for quantitative analysis, including 17 studies on glucocerebrosidase (GBA), 25 studies on Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and 7 on parkin (PRKN) genes, and 3 studies on alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) were used for qualitative analysis.

Asymptomatic carriers of GBA variants had higher severity of RBD during follow-up. Patients with PD carrying the LRRK2 G2019S variant had lower risk and severity of RBD compared with those without LRRK2 G2019S. Variants of GBA, LRRK2 and PRKN did not increase or decrease the risk and severity of excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome in PD.

Among the proteins that can abnormally accumulate are tau and α-synuclein, which can propagate in a prion-like manner and which upon aggregation, represent the most common intracellular proteinaceous lesions associated with neurodegeneration. For years it was thought that these intracellular proteins and their accumulation had no immediate relationship with extracellular homeostasis pathways such as the glymphatic clearance system; however, mounting evidence has now suggested that this is not the case. The involvement of the glymphatic system in neurodegenerative disease is yet to be fully defined; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that this pathway contributes to parenchymal solute clearance. Importantly, recent data show that proteins prone to intracellular accumulation are subject to glymphatic clearance, suggesting that this system plays a key role in many neurological disorders. In this review, we provide a background on the biology of tau and α-synuclein and discuss the latest findings on the cell-to-cell propagation mechanisms of these proteins. Importantly, we discuss recent data demonstrating that manipulation of the glymphatic system may have the potential to alleviate and reduce pathogenic accumulation of propagation-prone intracellular cytotoxic proteins. Furthermore, we will allude to the latest potential therapeutic opportunities targeting the glymphatic system that might have an impact as disease modifiers in neurodegenerative diseases.","Glymphatic, Propagation, Tauopathy, Synucleinopathy, Clearance, Aquaporin-4"

However, the complexity of AD pathogenesis leads to discrepancies in the understanding of this disease, and may be the main reason for the failure of AD drug development. Fortunately, many ongoing preclinical and clinical studies will continually open up avenues to unravel disease mechanisms and guide strategies for AD diagnosis and drug development. For example, immunotherapeutic strategies targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins were once deemed almost certainly effective in clinical treatment due to the excellent preclinical results. However, the repeated failures of clinical trials on vaccines and humanized anti-Aβ and anti-tau monoclonal antibodies have resulted in doubts on this strategy. Recently, a new anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody (Aducanumab) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which brings us back to the realization that immunotherapy strategies targeting Aβ may be still promising. Meanwhile, immunotherapies based on other targets such as tau, microglia and gut-brain axis are also under development. Further research is still needed to clarify the forms and epitopes of targeted proteins to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of immunotherapeutic drugs.

Both genes are important in the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (ALP), defects of which are associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation. LRRK2 regulates macroautophagy via activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) kinase (MEK) and the calcium-dependent adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways. Phosphorylation of Rab GTPases by LRRK2 regulates lysosomal homeostasis and endosomal trafficking. Mutant LRRK2 impairs chaperone-mediated autophagy, resulting in α-syn binding and oligomerization on lysosomal membranes. Mutations in GBA reduce glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, leading to glucosylceramide accumulation, α-syn aggregation and broad autophagic abnormalities. LRRK2 and GBA influence each other: GCase activity is reduced in LRRK2 mutant cells, and LRRK2 kinase inhibition can alter GCase activity in GBA mutant cells. Clinically, LRRK2 G2019S mutation seems to modify the effects of GBA mutation, resulting in milder symptoms than those resulting from GBA mutation alone. However, dual mutation carriers have an increased risk of PD and earlier age of onset compared with single mutation carriers, suggesting an additive deleterious effect on the initiation of PD pathogenic processes. Crosstalk between LRRK2 and GBA in PD exists, but its exact mechanism is unclear. Drugs that inhibit LRRK2 kinase or activate GCase are showing efficacy in pre-clinical models. Since LRRK2 kinase and GCase activities are also altered in idiopathic PD (iPD), it remains to be seen if these drugs will be useful in disease modification of iPD.","Parkinson’s disease, Interaction, LRRK2, GBA, GCase, Mutation, Autophagy, α-Synuclein"
"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in Alzheimer’s disease and its pharmaceutical potential","Lina Gao & Weihong Song","Weihong Song","weihong@wmu.edu.cn","28 January 2022","Synaptic abnormalities are a cardinal feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that are known to arise as the disease progresses. A growing body of evidence suggests that pathological alterations to neuronal circuits and synapses may provide a mechanistic link between amyloid β (Aβ) and tau pathology and thus may serve as an obligatory relay of the cognitive impairment in AD. Brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNFs) play an important role in maintaining synaptic plasticity in learning and memory. Considering AD as a synaptic disorder, BDNF has attracted increasing attention as a potential diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutical molecule for AD. Although depletion of BDNF has been linked with Aβ accumulation, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, the exact mechanisms underlying the effect of impaired BDNF signaling on AD are still unknown. Here, we present an overview of how BDNF genomic structure is connected to factors that regulate BDNF signaling. We then discuss the role of BDNF in AD and the potential of BDNF-targeting therapeutics for AD.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Alzheimer’s disease, Amyloid β protein, Tau protein, Neuroinflammation, Neuronal apoptosis"
"Excitotoxicity, calcium and mitochondria: a triad in synaptic neurodegeneration","Manish Verma, Britney N. Lizama & Charleen T. Chu","Charleen T. Chu","ctc4@pitt.edu","25 January 2022","Glutamate is the most commonly engaged neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, acting to mediate excitatory neurotransmission. However, high levels of glutamatergic input elicit excitotoxicity, contributing to neuronal cell death following acute brain injuries such as stroke and trauma. While excitotoxic cell death has also been implicated in some neurodegenerative disease models, the role of acute apoptotic cell death remains controversial in the setting of chronic neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, it is clear that excitatory synaptic dysregulation contributes to neurodegeneration, as evidenced by protective effects of partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. Here, we review evidence for sublethal excitatory injuries in relation to neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington’s disease. In contrast to classic excitotoxicity, emerging evidence implicates dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium handling in excitatory post-synaptic neurodegeneration. We discuss mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial calcium uptake and release, the impact of LRRK2, PINK1, Parkin, beta-amyloid and glucocerebrosidase on mitochondrial calcium transporters, and the role of autophagic mitochondrial loss in axodendritic shrinkage. Finally, we discuss strategies for normalizing the flux of calcium into and out of the mitochondrial matrix, thereby preventing mitochondrial calcium toxicity and excitotoxic dendritic loss. While the mechanisms that underlie increased uptake or decreased release of mitochondrial calcium vary in different model systems, a common set of strategies to normalize mitochondrial calcium flux can prevent excitatory mitochondrial toxicity and may be neuroprotective in multiple disease contexts.","Mitochondrial calcium, Mitochondrial calcium uniporter, NCLX antiporter, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, LRRK2, PINK1, Beta-amyloid, Mitophagy, Excitotoxicity, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Glucocerebrosidase"

Microglia perform multiple functions in the central nervous system, including surveillance, phagocytosis and release of a variety of soluble factors. Importantly, a majority of their functions are closely related to changes in their metabolism. This natural inter-dependency between core microglial properties and metabolism offers a unique opportunity to modulate microglial activities via nutritional or metabolic interventions. In this review, we examine the existing scientific literature to synthesize the hypothesis that microglial phagocytosis of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be selectively enhanced via metabolic interventions. We first review the basics of microglial metabolism and the effects of common metabolites, such as glucose, lipids, ketone bodies, glutamine, pyruvate and lactate, on microglial inflammatory and phagocytic properties. Next, we examine the evidence for dysregulation of microglial metabolism in AD. This is followed by a review of in vivo studies on metabolic manipulation of microglial functions to ascertain their therapeutic potential in AD. Finally, we discuss the effects of metabolic factors on microglial phagocytosis of healthy synapses, a pathological process that also contributes to the progression of AD. We conclude by enlisting the current challenges that need to be addressed before strategies to harness microglial phagocytosis to clear pathological protein deposits in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders can be widely adopted.","Microglia, Metabolism, Alzheimer's disease, Neurodegeneration, Inflammation, Phagocytosis"

At the cellular and molecular levels, the neuronal cellular milieu of the AD brain exhibits metabolic abnormalities, compromised bioenergetics, impaired lipid metabolism, and reduced overall metabolic capacity, which lead to abnormal neural network activity and impaired neuroplasticity, thus accelerating the formation of extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The current absence of effective pharmacological therapies for AD points to the urgent need to investigate the benefits of non-pharmacological approaches such as physical exercise. Despite the evidence that regular physical activity can improve metabolic dysfunction in the AD state, inhibit different pathophysiological molecular pathways associated with AD, influence the pathological process of AD, and exert a protective effect, there is no clear consensus on the specific biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the advantages of physical exercise. Here, we review how physical exercise improves crucial molecular pathways and biological processes associated with metabolic disorders in AD, including glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, Aβ metabolism and transport, iron metabolism and tau pathology.

The pathogenesis of ALS remains largely unknown; however, inflammation of the spinal cord is a focus of ALS research and an important pathogenic process in ALS. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a major lipid mediator generated by the arachidonic-acid cascade and is abundant at inflammatory sites. PGE2 levels are increased in the postmortem spinal cords of ALS patients and in ALS model mice. Beneficial therapeutic effects have been obtained in ALS model mice using cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors to inhibit the biosynthesis of PGE2, but the usefulness of this inhibitor has not yet been proven in clinical trials. In this review, we present current evidence on the involvement of PGE2 in the progression of ALS and discuss the potential of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES) and the prostaglandin receptor E-prostanoid (EP) 2 as therapeutic targets for ALS. Signaling pathways involving prostaglandin receptors mediate toxic effects in the central nervous system. In some situations, however, the receptors mediate neuroprotective effects. Our recent studies demonstrated that levels of mPGES-1, which catalyzes the final step of PGE2 biosynthesis, are increased at the early-symptomatic stage in the spinal cords of transgenic ALS model mice carrying the G93A variant of superoxide dismutase-1. In addition, in an experimental motor-neuron model used in studies of ALS, PGE2 induces the production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent caspase-3-dependent cytotoxicity through activation of the EP2 receptor. Moreover, this PGE2-induced EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a role in the death of motor neurons in ALS model mice. Further understanding of the pathophysiological role of PGE2 in neurodegeneration may provide new insights to guide the development of novel therapies for ALS.","Prostaglandin E2, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Motor neuron death, E-prostanoid receptor, Microsomal prostaglandin E synthetase-1"

In addition to genetic factors, recent studies indicate that environmental and experiential factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Early life adversity (ELA) has a profound impact on brain function and health later in life. In rodent models, exposure to ELA results in specific cognitive deficits and aggravated AD pathology. Extensive concerns have been raised regarding the higher risk of developing cognitive impairments in people with a history of ELA. In this review, we scrutinize findings from human and animal studies focusing on the connection of ELA with cognitive impairment and AD. These discoveries suggest that ELA, especially at early postnatal stages, increases susceptibility to cognitive impairment and AD later in life. In terms of mechanisms, ELA could lead to dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, altered gut microbiome, persistent inflammation, oligodendrocyte dysfunction, hypomyelination, and aberrant adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Crosstalks among these events may synergistically contribute to cognitive impairment later in life. Additionally, we discuss several interventions that may alleviate adverse consequences of ELA. Further investigation into this crucial area will help improve ELA management and reduce the burden of related neurological conditions.","Early life adversity, Cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, Dementia, Stress"

This mechanistically regulated system delivers cargos (proteins, mRNAs and organelles such as mitochondria) back and forth from the soma to the synapse. Motor proteins like kinesins and dynein mechanistically regulate polarized anterograde (from the soma to the synapse) and retrograde (from the synapse to the soma) commute of the cargos, respectively. Proficient axonal transport of such cargos is achieved by altering the microtubule stability via post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, core components constructing the MTs. Occurring within the lumen of MTs, K40 acetylation of α-tubulin via α-tubulin acetyl transferase and its subsequent deacetylation by HDAC6 and SIRT2 are widely scrutinized PTMs that make the MTs highly flexible, which in turn promotes their lifespan. The movement of various motor proteins, including kinesin-1 (responsible for axonal mitochondrial commute), is enhanced by this PTM, and dyshomeostasis of neuronal MT acetylation has been observed in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is the second most common neurodegenerative condition and is closely associated with impaired MT dynamics and deregulated tubulin acetylation levels. Although the relationship between status of MT acetylation and progression of PD pathogenesis has become a chicken-and-egg question, our review aims to provide insights into the MT-mediated axonal commute of mitochondria and dyshomeostasis of MT acetylation in PD. The enzymatic regulators of MT acetylation along with their synthetic modulators have also been briefly explored. Moving towards a tubulin-based therapy that enhances MT acetylation could serve as a disease-modifying treatment in neurological conditions that lack it.","Parkinson’s disease, Microtubule acetylation, Tubulin, PTMs, Mitochondria, Axonal transport, HDAC6, SIRT2 inhibitors"

Atkin","sina.shadfar@mq.edu.au, Julie.atkin@mq.edu.au","14 April 2023","Redox homeostasis refers to the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and their elimination by antioxidants. It is linked to all important cellular activities and oxidative stress is a result of  imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant species. Oxidative stress perturbs many cellular activities, including processes that maintain the integrity of DNA. Nucleic acids are highly reactive and therefore particularly susceptible to damage. The DNA damage response detects and repairs these DNA lesions. Efficient DNA repair processes are therefore essential for maintaining cellular viability, but they decline considerably during aging. DNA damage and deficiencies in DNA repair are increasingly described in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington’s disease. Furthermore, oxidative stress has long been associated with these conditions. Moreover, both redox dysregulation and DNA damage increase significantly during aging, which is the biggest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the links between redox dysfunction and DNA damage, and their joint contributions to pathophysiology in these conditions, are only just emerging. This review will discuss these associations and address the increasing evidence for redox dysregulation as an important and major source of DNA damage in neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding these connections may facilitate a better understanding of disease mechanisms, and ultimately lead to the design of better therapeutic strategies based on preventing both redox dysregulation and DNA damage.

"Modulating arousal to overcome gait impairments in Parkinson’s disease: how the noradrenergic system may act as a double-edged sword","Anouk Tosserams, Bastiaan R. Bloem & Rick C. Helmich","Jorik Nonnekes","jorik.nonnekes@radboudumc.nl","26 March 2023","In stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, most people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience a general worsening of motor symptoms, including their gait impairments. However, a proportion of patients actually report benefits from experiencing—or even purposely inducing—stressful or high-arousal situations. Using data from a large-scale international survey study among 4324 people with PD and gait impairments within the online Fox Insight (USA) and ParkinsonNEXT (NL) cohorts, we demonstrate that individuals with PD deploy an array of mental state alteration strategies to cope with their gait impairment. Crucially, these strategies differ along an axis of arousal—some act to heighten, whereas others diminish, overall sympathetic tone. Together, our observations suggest that arousal may act as a double-edged sword for gait control in PD. We propose a theoretical, neurobiological framework to explain why heightened arousal can have detrimental effects on the occurrence and severity of gait impairments in some individuals, while alleviating them in others. Specifically, we postulate that this seemingly contradictory phenomenon is explained by the inherent features of the ascending arousal system: namely, that arousal is related to task performance by an inverted u-shaped curve (the so-called Yerkes and Dodson relationship). We propose that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus plays an important role in modulating PD symptom severity and expression, by regulating arousal and by mediating network-level functional integration across the brain. The ability of the locus coeruleus to facilitate dynamic ‘cross-talk’ between distinct, otherwise largely segregated brain regions may facilitate the necessary cerebral compensation for gait impairments in PD. In the presence of suboptimal arousal, compensatory networks may be too segregated to allow for adequate compensation. Conversely, with supraoptimal arousal, increased cross-talk between competing inputs of these complementary networks may emerge and become dysfunctional. Because the locus coeruleus degenerates with disease progression, finetuning of this delicate balance becomes increasingly difficult, heightening the need for mental strategies to self-modulate arousal and facilitate shifting from a sub- or supraoptimal state of arousal to improve gait performance. Recognition of this underlying mechanism emphasises the importance of PD-specific rehabilitation strategies to alleviate gait disability.","Arousal, Gait, Parkinson’s disease, Freezing of gait, Locus coeruleus"

Dysosmia is regarded as an early sign of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and nasal swabs are the gold standard for the detection. By nasal swabs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids can be cyclically amplified and detected using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction after sampling. Similarly, olfactory dysfunction precedes the onset of typical clinical manifestations by several years in prion diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. In neurodegenerative diseases, nasal swab tests are currently being explored using seed amplification assay (SAA) of pathogenic misfolded proteins, such as prion, α-synuclein, and tau. These misfolded proteins can serve as templates for the conformational change of other copies from the native form into the same misfolded form in a prion-like manner. SAA for misfolded prion-like proteins from nasal swab extracts has been developed, conceptually analogous to PCR, showing high sensitivity and specificity for molecular diagnosis of degenerative diseases even in the prodromal stage. Cyclic amplification assay of nasal swab extracts is an attractive and feasible method for accurate and non-invasive detection of trace amount of pathogenic substances for screening and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.","Nasal swab, Seed amplification assay, Prion disease, Amyloid, Neurodegenerative diseases"

Even though the specific cellular distribution of aggregated αSyn differs in PD and DLB patients, both groups show a significant pathological overlap, raising the discussion of whether PD and DLB are the same or different diseases. Besides clinical investigation, we will focus in addition on methodologies, such as protein seeding assays (real-time quaking-induced conversion), to discriminate between different types of α-synucleinopathies. This approach relies on the seeding conversion properties of misfolded αSyn, supporting the hypothesis that different conformers of misfolded αSyn may occur in different types of α-synucleinopathies. Understanding the pathological processes influencing the disease progression and phenotype, provoked by different αSyn conformers, will be important for a personalized medical treatment in future.","α-synucleinopathies,  α-synuclein, RT-QuIC, Protein strains"
"Alleviating the unwanted effects of oxidative stress on Aβ clearance: a review of related concepts and strategies for the development of computational modelling","Sarawoot Somin & Don Kulasiri","Don Kulasiri","don.kulasiri@lincoln.ac.nz","13 March 2023","Treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be more effective in the early stages. Although we do not completely understand the aetiology of the early stages of AD, potential pathological factors (amyloid beta [Aβ] and tau) and other co-factors have been identified as causes of AD, which may indicate some of the mechanism at work in the early stages of AD. Today, one of the primary techniques used to help delay or prevent AD in the early stages involves alleviating the unwanted effects of oxidative stress on Aβ clearance. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a product of lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress, plays a key role in the adduction of the degrading proteases. This HNE employs a mechanism which decreases catalytic activity. This process ultimately impairs Aβ clearance. The degradation of HNE-modified proteins helps to alleviate the unwanted effects of oxidative stress. Having a clear understanding of the mechanisms associated with the degradation of the HNE-modified proteins is essential for the development of strategies and for alleviating the unwanted effects of oxidative stress. The strategies which could be employed to decrease the effects of oxidative stress include enhancing antioxidant activity, as well as the use of nanozymes and/or specific inhibitors. One area which shows promise in reducing oxidative stress is protein design. However, more research is needed to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of this technique. This paper discusses the interplay of potential pathological factors and AD. In particular, it focuses on the effect of oxidative stress on the expression of the Aβ-degrading proteases through adduction of the degrading proteases caused by HNE. The paper also elucidates other strategies that can be used to alleviate the unwanted effects of oxidative stress on Aβ clearance. To improve the effectiveness and accuracy of protein design, we explain the application of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach.","Alzheimer’s disease, Oxidative stress, Amyloid beta clearance, Protein design"

Exercise can provide varying degrees of benefits to cognitive function at all stages of life cycle. Currently, with the aging of the world’s population and increase of life expectancy, cognitive dysfunction has gradually become a disease of high incidence, which is accompanied by neurodegenerative diseases in elderly individuals. Patients often exhibit memory loss, aphasia and weakening of orientation once diagnosed, and are unable to have a normal life. Cognitive dysfunction largely affects the physical and mental health, reduces the quality of life, and causes a great economic burden to the society. At present, most of the interventions are aimed to maintain the current cognitive level and delay deterioration of cognition. In contrast, exercise as a nonpharmacological therapy has great advantages in its nontoxicity, low cost and universal application. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of exercise on cognition are complex, and studies have been extensively centered on neural plasticity, the direct target of exercise in the brain. In addition, mitochondrial stability and energy metabolism are essential for brain status. Meanwhile, the organ-brain axis responds to exercise and induces release of cytokines related to cognition. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise on cognition, and point out directions for future research.","Exercise, Cognitive function, Molecular mechanism, Neurodegenerative disease, Nonpharmacological therapy"
